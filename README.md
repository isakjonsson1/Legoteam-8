# LEGO速 MINDSTORMS速 project

This repository contains all code related to a a LEGO速 MINDSTORMS速 coding project. 
The project is a collabarative project where we first design and code a racing robot that could follow a black line (representing the racing track) on a white background,
and secondly design and code a project of our own choosing.

# The project

For our own project, we decided to make a drawing robot that takes an svg file as an input, and draws the curves contained in the svg file by driving along the paths.
The robot consists of a two wheels and a retractable pen. The robot drives along a specified path and extends the pen when needed. 
The code for this project is located in the "Del 2" directory
